## **Abstract**

AI-assisted coding tools—such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code—significantly accelerate interface development through natural-language prompts. However, these systems are trained on large corpora that include years of inaccessible patterns. As a result, they frequently produce visually polished yet inaccessible interfaces.

This session presents a practical method for **"accessibility prompt engineering"**: techniques that guide AI tools toward output aligned with WCAG, ARIA best practices, and inclusive interaction patterns. Through demonstrations and real-world examples, attendees will learn how to shape prompts that yield semantic HTML, meaningful names/roles/states, robust keyboard interaction, and verifiable accessibility. The session also covers how to validate AI-generated code and how to operationalize a reusable prompt library so accessibility becomes a default outcome rather than a post-hoc fix.

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. **Diagnose** common accessibility failures produced by AI-generated UI code.

2. **Write** effective prompts that enforce semantic structure, keyboard operability, and sufficient color contrast.

3. **Apply** ARIA judiciously (and minimally) to complement, not replace, native semantics.

4. **Validate** outputs using automated checks (axe, Lighthouse, pa11y) and targeted manual testing.

5. **Establish** a team prompt library and review workflow to maintain accessibility quality at scale.
