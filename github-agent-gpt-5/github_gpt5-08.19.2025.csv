WCAG,A,1,low,1.3.1 Info and Relationships,Article element contains heading level that is improperly nested,One or more headings (created using h1 - h6 elements (without an ARIA-assigned role); or elements with a role attribute set to a value that starts with 'heading' and an aria-level attribute set to an appropriate value) inside an article element (excluding the contents of any further enclosed article elements) are not set to a heading level that can be considered as properly nested within the document heading hierarchy.,129,https://myplanet.hub.essentia11y.com/short-link/uIoyRNuNx5a8bnu2,"<article class=""article"" role=""listitem"" tabindex=""0"">...</article>","[   ""body>main:nth-of-type(1)>*:nth-child(5)>*:nth-child(2)>*:nth-child(1)"" ]",Article element contains heading level that is improperly nested,"When heading levels are skipped in an article, users of screen readers who are blind or low vision may not understand the relationship of sections of content.","Use heading elements in the proper order within an article element and the surrounding page. For example, a heading level 1 (<code>h1</code) generally indicates the primary purpose of the page and is followed by heading level 2 (<code>h2</code>).  A heading level 2 should not be followed by a heading level 4 (<code>h4</code>). Headings are not required to have sub-heading; for example, a heading level 2 (<code>h2</code>) section need not have any heading below it.   A rule of thumb is that in general, the heading level should match the visual representation of the heading level. It is possible to have a <code>h2</code> followed by an <code>h4</code> if the <code>h4</code> represents content that is perhaps lower in structure or importance than a <code>h3</code> where an <code>h3</code> might be used elsewhere in the same article. However, if the <code>h4</code> is really the next logical level after <code>h2</code> and doesn't match an <code>h4</code> visually from another part of the same article, or is not of lesser importance such as used in an error message or aside, then it should be an <code>h3</code> to communicate the structure.   Due to lack of support for the HTML5 sectional structure, headings need to align with the order of headings in the containing page and their corresponding HTML numbered heading levels (<code>h1</code>,<code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, etc.). or ARIA <code>role=""heading""</code> and <code>aria-level</code>."

When text does not have sufficient contrast some users may not be able to read the text or may miss the presence of the text altogether.","Use sufficient contrast for all text and images of text.  Text is that is not large text (not greater than or equal to 18pt or 14pt bolded), incidental, or a logo needs to have at least a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 to adjacent pixels.  This ratio is a minimum and many users with low vision need and benefit from more contrast to read text.  The color of the text,  background, or both can be adjusted to increase contrast.  Halos, opaque boxes, and other techniques may be useful to increase contrast in situations where text appears over non-solid backgrounds.  Authors need to ensure that contrast is maintained across responsive variations.  Use a Contrast Checker Tool to check the contrast ratio."

To address this issue, an appropriate role may need to be applied such as the role button for a button that expands/collapses additional content, etc.   When an <code>aria-expanded</code> attribute is not allowed and no appropriate element or ARIA role is available the ARIA attribute needs to be removed.  If the element with the <code>aria-expanded</code> attribute controls the expansion of another grouping container that is not 'owned by' the element, the author needs to reference the container by using the <code>aria-controls</code> attribute."
