When text does not have sufficient contrast some users may not be able to read the text or may miss the presence of the text altogether.","Use sufficient contrast for all text and images of text.  Text is that is not large text (not greater than or equal to 18pt or 14pt bolded), incidental, or a logo needs to have at least a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 to adjacent pixels.  This ratio is a minimum and many users with low vision need and benefit from more contrast to read text.  The color of the text,  background, or both can be adjusted to increase contrast.  Halos, opaque boxes, and other techniques may be useful to increase contrast in situations where text appears over non-solid backgrounds.  Authors need to ensure that contrast is maintained across responsive variations.  Use a Contrast Checker Tool to check the contrast ratio."

To address this issue, an appropriate role may need to be applied such as the role combobox for a combobox, etc.   When an <code>aria-autocomplete</code> attribute is not allowed and no appropriate element or ARIA role is available the ARIA attribute needs to be removed.

The aria-labelledby attribute must contain one or more ids of elements that label the form field. The <code>aria-label</code> or <code>title</code> attribute ideally is used when on-screen labels can not be used. Authors should place the string that labels the form field in the aria-label attribute.  When combo boxes are constructed using the input HTML element such as used in the ARIA 1.2 combobox pattern, label element correctly associated with the input of role combobox may also be used to provide an accessible name."
