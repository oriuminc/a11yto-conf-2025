For example, a heading level 1 (<code>h1</code>) generally indicates the primary purpose of the page and is followed by heading level 2 (<code>h2</code>).  A heading level 2 (<code>h2</code) should not be followed by a heading level 4 (<code>h4</code). Headings are not required to have sub-heading; for example, a heading level 2 (<code>h2</code>) section need not have any heading below it.   A rule of thumb is that in general, the heading level should match the visual representation of the heading level. It is possible to have a h2 followed by an h4 if the h4 (<code>h4</code>)represents content that is perhaps lower in structure or importance than a <code>h3</code> where an <code>h3</code> might be used elsewhere in the same article. However, if the <code>h4</code> is really the next logical level after <code>h2</code> and doesn't match an h4 visually from another part of the same article, or is not of lesser importance such as used in an error message or aside, then it should be an <code>h3</code> to communicate the structure.   Due to lack of support for the HTML5 sectional structure, heading need to align with the order of headings in the containing page and their corresponding HTML numbered heading levels (<code>h1</code>,<code>h2</code>,<code> h3</code>, etc.). ARIA <code>role=""heading""</code> and <code>aria-level</code> can also be used to properly order the numbered heading levels in HTML5 outline structure."
